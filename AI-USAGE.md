# AI Usage

I used **Claude Code** (Claude 4.5 Sonnet) throughout this challenge for:

## Planning & Research
- Researching modern CMS architecture patterns and headless CMS approaches
- Comparing template engines (Handlebars vs Nunjucks)
- Revising BEM methodology best practices
- Reviewing OWASP input validation strategies

## Code Implementation
- Generating boilerplate code (build scripts, templates, SCSS structure)
- Writing initial versions of build.js, Handlebars templates, and JavaScript (Using my personal projects as first reference)

## My Decisions & Work
All architectural and technical decisions were mine:
- Choosing the tech stack (Node.js, Handlebars, BEM, SCSS)
- Designing the data structure and component architecture
- Deciding to use JSON for this demo (Google Sheets would be better for production to empower account managers, but overkill here)
- Testing, debugging, and verifying all functionality
- Writing SOLUTION.md
